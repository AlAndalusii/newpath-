            <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mt-6 mb-3">🚨 Carnival Cruise Line’s Updated Age Policy (2024)</h3>
            
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
              <li>🔹 <strong>New Rule:</strong> As of <strong>February 1, 2024</strong>, passengers under <strong>21 years old</strong> <strong>cannot</strong> book a Carnival cruise alone.</li>
              <li>🔹 <strong>Guardian Requirement:</strong> Travelers <strong>under 21 must be accompanied by someone at least 25 years old</strong>.</li>
              <li>🔹 <strong>Prior Rule:</strong> Previously, <strong>18-year-olds</strong> could book cabins independently.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mt-6 mb-3">🚨 Royal Caribbean’s Policy (Existing)</h3>
            
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
              <li>🔹 Requires passengers <strong>under 21</strong> to be accompanied by a guardian aged <strong>at least 21</strong> (for North American sailings).</li>
              <li>🔹 Some international sailings allow <strong>18-year-olds</strong> to book alone, but <strong>this depends on the departure country</strong>.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mt-6 mb-3">🚨 Disney Cruise Line & Others</h3>
            
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
              <li>🔹 <strong>Disney Cruise Line:</strong> Minimum age to book alone is <strong>18</strong>, but some ships require an adult (21+) in a cabin.</li>
              <li>🔹 <strong>Other Cruise Lines:</strong> Many <strong>luxury and adult-focused cruises</strong> are increasing minimum age policies to enhance the onboard experience.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">💡 Why Are Cruise Lines Enforcing Stricter Age Restrictions?</h2>
            
            <p>These updated age policies aren’t random—they align with industry trends and address safety, liability, and evolving travel demographics.</p>
            
            <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mt-6 mb-3">🛑 1. Safety & Supervision Concerns</h3>
            
            <p>Large cruise ships are floating cities with nightclubs, casinos, and alcohol-serving bars. Without proper supervision, younger passengers may engage in risky behavior. Stricter policies ensure that minors and young adults have a responsible guardian onboard.</p>
            
            <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mt-6 mb-3">⚖️ 2. Legal & Liability Issues</h3>
            
            <p>Cruises must comply with international maritime laws and U.S. regulations. Underage drinking, legal responsibility for incidents, and parental consent issues are key concerns.</p>
            
            <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mt-6 mb-3">🌎 3. Global Age Restrictions & Policy Variations</h3>
            
            <p>Different countries have different legal drinking ages (U.S.: 21, Europe: 18, Mexico: 18). Cruise lines must standardize policies for consistency across international waters.</p>
            
            <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mt-6 mb-3">🚢 4. Shift Towards Adult-Focused Cruises</h3>
            
            <p>Many cruise lines are targeting older demographics, offering luxury, wellness, and adults-only experiences. Adult-only cruises are on the rise, catering to travelers who prefer a quiet, child-free vacation.</p>
            
            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">🌍 How These Changes Impact Young Travelers & Families</h2>
            
            <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mt-6 mb-3">🎓 College Travelers & Spring Break Groups</h3>
            
            <p>18 to 20-year-olds who previously booked cruises for spring break must now travel with a 25+ chaperone. This affects college students, young couples, and budget-conscious travelers.</p>
            
            <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mt-6 mb-3">👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 Family Vacation Planning</h3>
            
            <p>Families with older teens (18-20) must adjust their plans, ensuring an adult 25+ is included in the booking.</p>
